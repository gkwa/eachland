* eachland

** gpt

Write app to accept --root path /path/to/base/dir using
jessevdk/go-flags

Recurse over --root finding all files

Get sha256sum of all files and group by that

Report all files that are duplicates based off sha256sum

Create new function that accepts fileMap and prepares a list of files
that can be deleted since they're duplicates.

Its very important to not delete all the files, so we must keep one
from the list if the lenght if list is greater than 1.

** usage

Example:
#+begin_example
make
./eachland --help
./eachland --root /path/to/base/dir
#+end_example
